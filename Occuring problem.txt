Problem Statement:

LinkedIn's API has implemented stricter policies, requiring explicit user verification before allowing access to profile data. 
This restriction directly undermines the core objective of resume builder applications, which is to provide a user-friendly and readily
available solution for creating resumes. Instead of seamless and instant data import, users face an extra verification step, 
creating a barrier to entry and diminishing the app's intended ease of use.

While the verification process ensures user data protection, 
it inherently limits the app's ability to provide an effortless experience. 
Users cannot immediately leverage the convenience of auto-filling their resumes with LinkedIn profile data. 
This ultimately affects the app's accessibility and its potential to be a readily available tool for job seekers.
